write a BankAccount class, stored in a
module named bankaccount. Objects that are created from this class will simulate bank
accounts, allowing us to have a starting balance, make deposits, make withdrawals, and
get the current balance.

class BankAccount:
	def _ _init_ _(self, bal):
		self._ _balance = bal
	def deposit(self, amount):
		self._ _balance += amount
	def withdraw(self, amount):
	if self._ _balance >= amount:
		self._ _balance -= amount
	else:
		print('Error: Insufficient funds')

	def get_balance(self):
	return self._ _balance
